# pytorch-yolo3
This version is converted from marvis/pytorch-yolo3 branch[python3], 
there are some minor bugs with marvi's repo when loading the weights, fourtunately I had found the solution when looking through Issues#15
So I decided to push running version here. Subsequntly, I will transform this version to pytorch0.4 and add more practical utils for cam-Real-time-detection .
